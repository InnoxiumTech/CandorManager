A new breed of mod manager

# Thanks
I would like to say thank you right away to the following people:

[@CGJennings](https://github.com/CGJennings/jar-loader) - Allowing me to load modules from external jars  
[@bl4ckscor3](https://github.com/bl4ckscor3) - Creating the amazing splash screen artwork!

# What is Candor?
Candor aims to be a mod manager that will remove the need 
for a new separate manager for every game.

# Mission Statement
Candor will be able to install mods to a specified mods folder on a per-game basis,
it will also be able to uninstall them without leaving any traces 
(except for any files created by the mods themselves, although this may be looked in to later)

Candor will achieve this by having modules that be added or removed at any time.
Each module should only support one game.
Modules _could_ support more than one game, but only if those games have the same mod installation method.
Each module will be a JAR file that can be loaded from the "modules" folder in the Candor install location.
Candor will provide a robust API for developers to create new modules, via maven

# What isn't Candor?
Candor does not aim to be a replacement for highly specialised mod installers, a la Nexus Mod Manager, Vortex, OpenIV, etc.

# Why Open Source?
I do not believe in paying for mods and/or mod software.
I also believe that some people abuse free software by including hidden tracking and/or malware inside these applications.
For this reason I have chosen to have Candor be open source for price of mind of the user, and developers.

# Can I contribute to Candor
Absolutely! You are more than welcome to suggest features and improvements.
Please contact me about feasibility before submitting a PR or Issue.
Lastly, I would like to note that I will have final say on what goes in to Candor, sorry!

# Would you accept donations?
While I would never ask for a donation, it will always be appreciated.
Any donations will go straight back in to the project for things like:
Server hosting, domain registry, etc.

## Will you include x feature if I donate?
Sorry, that's a no, if I choose to add a feature, it will because I think it is the right fit for Candor,
and not because someone is paying me to do so.
Please contact me if you would like to donate.
